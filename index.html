<h1>THIS IS ABOUT HTML</h1>
<div style="background-color: blueviolet;">
    HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text,
    images, and other material into visible or audible web pages.Default characteristics
    for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics
    can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS.
    Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report
    TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting
    languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s
    for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands
    were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents.
    However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements 
    (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, 
    with separate structure and markup.HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.

<h1>THIS IS ABOUT CSS</h1>
    <div>
CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, 
colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more 
flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable 
multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate 
.css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable 
the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share 
the file and its formatting.Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible 
to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, 
such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), 
and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if 
the content is accessed on a mobile device.

    <h1>THIS IS ABOUT PHP</h1>
    <div>
        PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".
        PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage 
        dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.
        It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, 
        Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, 
        especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started,
        executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time.PHP supports
        a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added support for 
        java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development 
        a possibility for the first time.PHP is forgiving: PHP language tries to be as forgiving as possible.
        PHP Syntax is C-Like.

    <h1>THIS IS ABOUT JAVASCRIPT</h1>
    <div>
        JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming 
        language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting 
        language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, 
        Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, 
        single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative 
        (e.g. functional programming) styles.
